This is a project that uses nw.js and Material Components for the web.

The assets folder is excluded from git because it contains copyrighted sounds (meant for personal use only) If you replace the sound files, you can see the sound system in action, but it is optional.

This project was never finished but hopefully it demonstrates some of my capabilities.
